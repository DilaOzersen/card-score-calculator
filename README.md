# My Web Application
# PURPOSE
The purpose of my project is to basically implement a specific version of a calculator.
This can help with many things outside of my interest (which is video games), an example is database analytics.
A user can pull random cards and set them to a team, which will then have a score calculated for them.

## Project Setup
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd my-web-application
```

2. **Make sure to run npm install**

```
